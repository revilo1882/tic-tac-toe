# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction

A playable tic-tac-toe game built by following a step-by-step guide in an [Intro to React Tutorial] (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Task

At the end of the tutorial some further challenges were set to practice your new React skills:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.


## Motivation

Learn about using the popular Javascript Library React and how to manage data flow within a React project to improve my frontend developer skills.


## Installation

Clone the repository then in the command line run:

```bash
$ cd tic-tac-toe
$ npm install
$ npm start
```


## Further Work

- Test the project.
